## Biography

I am a PhD candidate of cognitive neuroscience at the CARELab (PI: Prof. Xun Liu) of Institute of Psychology, CAS. My research interests focus on the neural and cognitive mechanisms of social learning during interpersonal co-opetition using computational modeling.

### Interests

- Social Learning
- Computational modeling
- Interpersonal Co-opetition
- Artificial Intelligence


## Major Project Experiences
### Neural and Computational Mechanisms Underlying the Interpersonal Co-opetition (National Natural Science Foundation Project, 2021-2024)
- Conceptualized the trade-off between cooperation for common benefits and competition for individual gain as \textbf{interpersonal co-opetition} and designed a novel experimental paradigm, the "**Share Game**."
- Developed a systematic approach to combined with **Bayesian network analysis**, **reinforcement learning**, and **model-based fMRI** approaches to investigate the neural and computational mechanisms.
- Identified the contribution of **interaction between asymmetric inequality aversions and action-weighted counterfactual learning** to irrational competitive behaviors.


### Brain-Inspired Autonomous System (Huawei Central Research Institute)
- Came up with the idea of **combining the computational models of human cognition with artificial intelligence** for next generation of autonomous system framework.
- The proposal has been tracked as a key direction of Huawei’s Overall Reference Architecture Baseline (2023-2026) and applied into areas of **smart city, network traffic forecast, and emergency management**.

### Crossmodal Learning: Adaptivity, Prediction and Interaction (NSFC-DFG Transregional Collaborative Research, TRR169)
- Built the computational models of **social learning and value-based decision-making** and conducted **hierarchical Bayesian analysis** with R and cmdstanr.
- Collaborated closely with Department of Informatics and Psychology, University of Hamburg, as well as UKE, and participated in bilateral Sino-German workshops and seminars regularly.


### Chinese Child Brain Development (Science and Technology Innovation 2030 - Major Project on Brain and Brain-Inspired Research)
- Provided leadership to the collection of **structural MRI, DTI, task-based and resting-state fMRI**, and the analysis of the **developmental trajectory** of the brain and cognition in children and adolescents.
