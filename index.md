## Biography

I am a PhD candidate of cognitive neuroscience at the CARELab (PI: Prof. Xun Liu) of Institute of Psychology, CAS. My research interests focus on the psychological and neural mechanisms of interpersonal coopetition using behavioral modeling and neuroeconomics.

### Interests

- Interpersonal Coopetition
- Social Learning & Decision-making
- Brain-Inspired Autonomous System (BIAS)


## Major Project Experiences
### Cognitive Neural Mechanisms Underlying the Impact of Social Comparison on the Dynamic Trade-off of Interpersonal Competition and Cooperation (National Natural Science Foundation Project, 2024-2027)
- As one of the **key participants in charge**, I took on tasks ranging from problem proposing, paradigm development, project application, environment setup, data collection, project management, data analysis, paper writing, and project reporting.
- The project utilized **scales, behaviors, EEGs, and fMRI** to investigate the cognitive neural mechanisms of interpersonal coopetition. **Computational models** were built for fitting purposes based on brain activation changes induced by dynamic trade-off during such social exchanges.

### Brain-Inspired Autonomous System (Service Lab at 2012 Central Research Institute)
- Based on the mechanisms of advanced human cognitive processing, this project innovatively proposed a **Brain-Inspired Autonomous System (BIAS)** by blending the cutting-edge fields of autonomous systems, brain science, computational modelling, and cognitive neuroscience. Through mathematical models, it simulated human cognitive processes such as **belief updating, value-based decision making, conflict monitoring, and knowledge graphing**.
- The project explored its application in areas like traffic flow forecasting, user experience, operational efficiency, and resource utilization. This research direction has been included in Huawei's key research track in the **Autonomous Driving Network L5 Overall Reference Architecture Baseline (2023-2026)**.
